      "url": "https://doi.org/10.3758/s13414-018-1549-0",
      "summary": "This study demonstrates that observers can simultaneously maintain multiple attentional control settings (MACS) at different spatial locations without being confounded by repetition priming. Using a spatial cueing paradigm, the authors found that attentional capture occurred only when the distractorâ€™s color matched the control setting for that specific location, not due to repetition. These results provide strong behavioral evidence for location-specific top-down attentional settings."

      "url": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02884",
      "summary": "This study investigated how attentional orienting induced by non-informative cues can be shaped by reinforcement learning. Participants were more likely to attend to a spatial location previously associated with reward, even when the cue itself held no informative value. The findings support the view that value-based learning mechanisms can modulate attentional priority, even in the absence of explicit task relevance."

      "url": "https://doi.org/10.3758/s13414-020-02171-3",
      "summary": "This paper explores how uncertainty influences value-driven attentional capture (VDAC). The authors found that when the reward predictability was low, previously reward-associated distractors captured more attention, indicating a stronger VDAC effect. These findings suggest that uncertainty amplifies the attentional priority given to stimuli with learned value, possibly as an adaptive mechanism for coping with ambiguous environments."
