Hi, I'm Sanga Cho. 

I'm a PhD student in [Sam Ling's lab](https://sites.bu.edu/vision/) at Boston University.

My central research questions are:	
1.	How does the attentional system selectively modulate visual perception?
2.	What are the neural mechanisms of bottom-up and top-down processes in early visual processing that optimize visual experience?

To answer these questions, my research aims to:
1.	Utilize psychological and experimental approaches to characterize how attention shapes perceptual experience
2.	Investigate behavioral, psychophysical, and neuroimaging evidence for feedforward and feedback mechanisms in visual processing
